    <h1>Terms of service</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Chatty! These Terms of Service (“Terms”), which include and hereby incorporate the Privacy Policy at
        https://chattyapp.xyz/privacy_policy.html (“Privacy Policy”), are a legal agreement between Discord Inc. and
        its related
        companies (the “Company,” “us,” “our,” or "we") and you ("you" or “your”). By using or accessing the Discord
        application (the “App”) or the website located at https://chattyapp.xyz (the "Site"), which are collectively
        referred to as the “Service,” you agree (i) that you are 13 years of age or older, (ii) if you are the age of
        majority in your jurisdiction or over, that you have read, understood, and accept to be bound by the Terms, and
        (iii) if you are between 13 and the age of majority in your jurisdiction, that your legal guardian has reviewed
        and agrees to these Terms.

        The Company reserves the right to update these Terms, which we may do for reasons that include, but are not
        limited to, complying with changes to the law or reflecting enhancements to Discord. If the changes affect your
        usage of Discord or your legal rights, we’ll notify you no less than seven days before the changes take effect.
        Unless we state otherwise, your continued use of the Service after we post modifications will constitute your
        acceptance of and agreement to those changes. If you object to the changes, your recourse shall be to cease
        using the Service.
        <br><br>

        limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use and access the Service
        solely for your personal, non-commercial use, unless we agree to your commercial use in writing. You agree not
        to (and not to attempt to) (i) use the Service for any use or purpose other than as expressly permitted by
        these Terms;(ii) copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer,
        publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast, attempt to discover any source code, reverse

        expressly permitted in these Terms; or (iii) use data mining, robots, spiders, or similar data gathering and
        extraction tools on the Service. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any
